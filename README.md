# LIFX Enhanced Drivers for Hubitat

This repo provides enhanced drivers for LIFX bulbs, using the built-in LIFX Integration app and
LIFX classes.  To use these drivers, add the relevant groovy files in the "Drivers Code" section
of your hub.  Discover your bulbs using the built-in Integration, then change the device "Type" 
(driver) selection to the custom one provided by this repo.  Be sure to hit "Configure" on the
Device page after changing the driver.
